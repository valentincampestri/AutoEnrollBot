# AutoEnrollBot

AutoEnrollBot is a Python bot designed to automatically enroll in university courses. It allows you to select the course, location (sede), and schedule (turno), and it will continuously refresh the enrollment page to secure a spot. You can provide multiple schedule alternatives, and the bot will try to grab the first available spot. If no specific day or time is given, it will automatically select the first available option.

## Features
- **Choose Your Course:** Select the courses you want to enroll in.
- **Select Location (Sede):** Choose which campus (sede) you want to enroll in.
- **Pick Your Turno (Schedule):** Specify your preferred turno (morning, afternoon, or evening).
- **Flexible Schedule Options:**

  - If you want the bot to pick the first available day, simply leave it empty, and it will grab the next available spot.

- **Multiple Courses Simultaneously:** Enroll in up to 5 different courses at the same time. The bot will try to enroll in each of them one by one.
